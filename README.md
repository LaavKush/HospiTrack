**Smart Hospital Hygiene & Air Quality Monitoring System**

Introduction

Healthcare facilities, particularly government hospitals in India, serve millions of patients daily. However, poor hygiene, improper waste management, and deteriorating air quality contribute to hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), endangering both patients and visitors.

To address this issue, we propose the Smart Hospital Hygiene & Air Quality Monitoring System, an IoT, AI/ML, and MERN stack-based solution that ensures real-time monitoring of air quality and sanitation levels in hospitals. The system automatically generates complaints and escalates unresolved issues to municipal authorities, ensuring timely intervention and improved healthcare environments.

Features

* Real-time air quality monitoring using IoT sensors (ESP32/Raspberry Pi).
* AI-powered sanitation monitoring with computer vision.
* Automated complaint generation with image evidence.
* Complaint escalation mechanism with tracking & penalties.
* Public complaint portal & mobile app for patient participation.
* Municipal dashboard to manage hygiene issues efficiently.

Problem Statement

* Hospitals often suffer from poor sanitation and air quality.
* Lack of real-time monitoring leads to delayed waste management.
* Patients and visitors are at risk of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).
* Manual complaint mechanisms are ineffective and lack transparency.

Objectives

✔ Ensure continuous monitoring of hygiene and air quality.
✔ Automate complaint generation & escalation for rapid resolution.
✔ Minimize HAIs and improve patient safety.
✔ Enable public participation through a complaint portal.
✔ Improve municipal efficiency through real-time data access.

System Architecture

1. IoT-Based Real-Time Monitoring

* Air Quality Sensors (ESP32/Raspberry Pi): Monitors PM2.5, CO2, VOCs, temperature, and humidity, sending instant alerts.
* Smart AI Cameras: Detect waste accumulation and unclean toilets using computer vision.
* Monitor Display in Hospitals: Shows microbial levels & AQI for awareness.

2. Automated Complaint Generation & Escalation

* AI-Powered Issue Detection: Auto-generates complaints with image evidence.
* Twilio API for Alerts: Sends SMS/WhatsApp notifications to municipal officers.
* Escalation Mechanism: Auto-escalates issues if unresolved within a set time, applying penalties for delays.
